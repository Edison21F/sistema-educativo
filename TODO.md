# Passport.js Authentication System - Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Database Models Enhancement
- [x] Create Teacher SQL model with encrypted fields
- [x] Create Student SQL model with encrypted fields  
- [x] Create Administrator SQL model with encrypted fields
- [x] Update database ORM configuration with new models
- [x] Configure relationships between user types and roles

## Phase 2: Enhanced Passport Strategies
- [x] Refactor existing Passport strategies
- [x] Add proper password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Implement administrator login strategy
- [x] Add comprehensive signup strategies for all user types
- [x] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [x] Add role-based serialization/deserialization

## Phase 3: Authentication Controllers
- [x] Create comprehensive authentication controller
- [x] Implement login endpoints for all user types
- [x] Add registration endpoints with validation
- [x] Create password reset functionality
- [x] Add profile management with encrypted data handling
- [x] Implement role-based access control functions

## Phase 4: Enhanced Security & Encryption
- [x] Improve encryption utilities with field-specific functions
- [x] Add secure password hashing utilities
- [x] Create data validation before encryption
- [x] Add utility functions for bulk encryption/decryption

## Phase 5: Authentication Routes & Middleware
- [x] Create authentication routes
- [x] Implement role-based middleware for route protection
- [x] Add API endpoints for user management
- [x] Create logout and session cleanup routes

## Phase 6: User Management System
- [x] Implement user profile CRUD operations
- [x] Add role assignment and management
- [x] Create account activation/deactivation features
- [x] Implement user search and filtering

## Phase 7: Testing & Validation
- [x] Create input validation middleware
- [x] Add authentication testing endpoints
- [x] Improve error handling
- [x] Test all endpoints with curl commands (partially completed)

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Final Steps
- [x] Build and test the application (Server running successfully)
- [ ] Commit and push changes to repository
- [ ] Verify all functionality working correctly (API endpoints responding)
